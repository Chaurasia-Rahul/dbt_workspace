In dbt, there isn't a built-in feature for automatically refreshing materialized views. However, you can achieve this by leveraging external
scheduling tools like dbt Cloud, Airflow, or other scheduling solutions.

Here's a general approach using dbt Cloud as an example:

1. **Set up dbt Cloud**: If you're not already using dbt Cloud, sign up for an account and connect it to your dbt project repository.

2. **Create a dbt Cloud Job**: In dbt Cloud, you can create Jobs that execute your dbt models. Configure a Job that specifically targets the materialized view you want to refresh.

3. **Schedule the Job**: Set up a schedule for the Job to run at the desired frequency. You can configure it to run daily, hourly, or at any other interval that suits your needs.

4. **Notification**: Configure notifications so that you're informed of the Job's success or failure.
     This ensures that you're alerted if there are any issues with refreshing the materialized view.

5. **Testing**: Before setting up the schedule, ensure that your materialized view behaves as expected.
     You can manually trigger the Job to ensure that it refreshes the materialized view correctly.

6. **Monitoring**: After setting up the scheduled Job, monitor its execution to ensure that the materialized view continues to refresh as expected. 
    If any issues arise, investigate and address them promptly.

By following these steps, you can effectively automate the refreshing of materialized views in dbt using dbt Cloud or similar scheduling solutions. 
Remember to consider factors like data freshness requirements, query performance, and resource utilization when scheduling the refreshes.
